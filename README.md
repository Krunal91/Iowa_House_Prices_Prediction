# Iowa House Price Prediction In Ipython Notebook
## Sold! How do home features add up to its price tag?

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

The potential for creative feature engineering provides a rich opportunity for fun and learning. This dataset lends itself to advanced regression techniques like random forests and gradient boosting with the popular XGBoost library. We encourage Kagglers to create benchmark code and tutorials on Kernels for community learning. Top kernels will be awarded swag prizes at the competition close. 

## Files and Data Descriptions  
#### 1. notebooks  
This folder contains all the ipython file about algorithms, data cleaning an data visualization. 

#### 2. pickles  
This folder saves the intermediate data files which has been generated after applying some specific transformation on the original data.  

#### 3. images  
This folder saves the images generated during data analysis process.  

#### 4. results  
It is responsible for final out data with predicted prices.  


## Code Files:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Visualization
3. All_algorithms
4. PCA with Lasso Regression
5. Best algorithms

All the code files are located in the notebook folder.

## How to run the code ?
You have to run "Data Preprocessing" file first. Just open the file in jupyter and run all the cell.  

**Data Preprocessing -> Data Visulization -> All_algorithms / Best Algorithms / PCA with Lasso (You can select  any one of these three)**  

**File execution should follow above pipeline.**

### Packages Required:

**Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Pickles, Warnings**
